# Video Assets

Video files are excluded from the repository to reduce size for Replit deployment.

## Demo Videos

The following demo videos are referenced in the main README but not stored in git:

- `demo.mov` - Demo video showing the Hume AI plugin in action
- `rizz-omi-setup.MOV` - Setup tutorial video  
- `notification.MP4` - Notification demonstration video

## How to Get These Videos

If you need these video files:

1. **Download from releases**: Check the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Johnsonbros/omi/releases) page for asset downloads
2. **Use Git LFS**: If configured, run `git lfs pull` to download large files
3. **Contact maintainers**: Reach out to the project maintainers for access to the original files

## Creating Your Own Videos

You can create your own demo videos by:

1. Setting up the Hume AI plugin following the instructions in the main README
2. Recording your screen while using the application
3. Placing your videos in this directory for local development (they won't be committed to git)

Note: These files are automatically excluded via `.gitignore` to keep the repository size under 8GB for Replit deployment.
