# Documentation Video Assets

Video files are excluded from the repository to reduce size for Replit deployment.

## Videos

- `updating_your_omi.mp4` (~22MB) - Tutorial video showing how to update your Omi device firmware

## How to Get These Videos

If you need these video files for documentation:

1. **Download from releases**: Check the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Johnsonbros/omi/releases) page
2. **Use Git LFS**: If configured, run `git lfs pull` to download large files
3. **YouTube/Hosted Alternative**: Consider hosting videos on YouTube or Vimeo and embedding links

## For Documentation Contributors

When adding documentation videos:

1. Keep videos short and focused (under 5MB if possible)
2. Use compressed formats (MP4 with H.264 codec)
3. Consider hosting on video platforms and linking instead of storing in git
4. If you must include videos, use Git LFS (Large File Storage)

Note: These files are automatically excluded via `.gitignore` to keep the repository size under 8GB for Replit deployment.
